## About Project
In React development, keeping track of how your application data changes over time is called state management. By managing the state of your application, you will be able to make dynamic apps that respond to user input. There are many methods of managing state in React, including class-based state management and third-party libraries like Redux. In this tutorial, you’ll manage state on functional components using a method encouraged by the official React documentation: Hooks.

Hooks are a broad set of tools that run custom functions when a component’s props change. Since this method of state management doesn’t require you to use classes, developers can use Hooks to write shorter, more readable code that is easy to share and maintain. One of the main differences between Hooks and class-based state management is that there is no single object that holds all of the state. Instead, you can break up state into multiple pieces that you can update independently.

Have learned how to set state using the useState and useReducer Hooks. The useState Hook is valuable when setting a value without referencing the current state; the useReducer Hook is useful when you need to reference a previous value or when you have different actions the require complex data manipulations. To explore these different ways of setting state, have created a product page component with a shopping cart that will update by adding purchases from a list of options.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
